1. Install Cubase 7 on your computer.
2. Install the latest update if available in the Steinberg Download Assistant or on the Steinberg website.
3. Open the eLicenser Control Center. You will find it under 'Program Files' (Windows) or 'Applications' (Mac OS X).
4. Apply the 'Maintenance & Online Synchronisation' by clicking on 'Perform Maintenance Tasks' (or click on the 'Maintenance' button at the top right if not shown).
5. If you have a download access code, redeem it in the Steinberg Download Assistant. An activation code will be automatically generated and used to download and activate your license.
6. If you have an activation code, enter it in the eLicenser Control Center. The license will be downloaded and stored either in the Soft-eLicenser - locally on hard disk - or on a connected USB-eLicenser (dongle).

If you do not have a valid activation code or a download access code, you may be tempted to use a keygen to generate one. A keygen is a software that can create random codes that may work for some software products. However, using a keygen for Cubase 7 is not recommended for several reasons:

- A keygen may not work for Cubase 7, as the activation process is secured by the eLicenser system that verifies the authenticity of the code.
- A keygen may contain viruses or malware that can harm your computer or compromise your personal data.
- A keygen may violate the terms and conditions of Steinberg and result in legal consequences or loss of support.

Therefore, it is advisable to purchase a legitimate license for Cubase 7 from Steinberg or an authorized dealer. This way, you can enjoy all the features and benefits of Cubase 7 without risking your security or breaking the law.

Cubase 7 is not only a powerful music production software, but also a versatile tool for composing, arranging and editing music. Features like Expression Maps and Note Expression in recent versions were great additions for musicians who use the program as a compositional tool, and, in Cubase 7, Steinberg continue this tradition with extensive new functionality for working with chords.
 
## The Chord Track
 
The Chord Track is a new global track that can be added to any project. It allows you to create and edit chord progressions, and also to harmonize existing MIDI or audio tracks with the chords. You can enter chords manually by using the mouse or a MIDI keyboard, or you can use the Chord Assistant to generate chords based on various criteria, such as complexity, similarity or tension. You can also analyze existing MIDI or audio tracks and extract the chords from them.
 
The Chord Track can also influence other tracks in your project by using the Chord Track mode. This mode can be enabled for any MIDI or instrument track, and it will automatically transpose the notes to match the chords on the Chord Track. You can choose between different voicing options, such as basic chords, piano or guitar voicings. You can also enable the Follow Chord Scale option, which will ensure that all notes are within the scale of the current chord.
 
Another way to use the Chord Track is to generate harmonies for vocal or instrumental parts. You can do this by using the Generate Harmony Voices function, which will create new audio tracks with pitch-shifted copies of the original part. You can specify how many harmony voices you want, and how they should be arranged relative to the chords. You can also edit the harmonies manually by using VariAudio.
 
## The Chord Pads
 
The Chord Pads are a new feature that let you trigger and play chords in real time. They are located at the bottom of the Project window, and they consist of 16 pads that can be assigned to different chords. You can use the mouse or a MIDI controller to play the pads, and you can also record them into a MIDI track.
 
The Chord Pads are linked to the Chord Track, so they will always reflect the current chord progression. You can also drag and drop chords from the Chord Track to the pads, or vice versa. You can customize the appearance and behavior of each pad by using the Pad Settings panel. Here you can change the color, name and symbol of each pad, as well as adjust parameters such as velocity, duration and tension.
 
One of the most interesting features of the Chord Pads is the Remote Control section. This section allows you to assign different functions to different keys on your MIDI keyboard, such as changing octaves, inversions or voicings of the chords. You can also assign functions to modulate or arpeggiate the chords, or to trigger chord events such as strumming or sliding.
 
## Conclusion
 
Cubase 7 offers a comprehensive set of features for working with chords and harmonies in your music production. Whether you want to create chord progressions from scratch, harmonize existing tracks, or play chords live, Cubase 7 has you covered. The new Chord Track and Chord Pads are easy to use and integrate seamlessly with the rest of Cubase's functionality. They are also fun and inspiring tools that can help you discover new musical possibilities.
